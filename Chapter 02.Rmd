# Time series in R

## `ts` objects and `ts` function

A time series is stored in a `ts` object in R:

 - a list of numbers
 - information about times those numbers were recorded.

### Example

```{r tstable, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
x <- c(123,39,78,52,110)
yr <- 2012:2016
knitr::kable(data.frame(Year=yr,Observation=x), booktabs=TRUE)
```

```r
y <- ts(c(123,39,78,52,110), start=2012)
```

## `ts` objects and `ts` function

For observations that are more frequent than once per year, add a `frequency` argument.

E.g., monthly data stored as a numerical vector `z`:

```r
y <- ts(z, frequency=12, start=c(2003, 1))
```

## `ts` objects and `ts` function

### `ts(data, frequency, start)`

\begin{tabular}{lrl}

  ylab("$ million") +
  ggtitle("Seasonal plot: antidiabetic drug sales")
```

## Seasonal plots

  * Data plotted against the individual "seasons" in which the data were observed.  (In this case a "season" is a month.)
  * Something like a time plot except that the data from each season are overlapped.
  * Enables the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen more clearly, and also allows any substantial departures from the seasonal pattern to be easily identified.
  * In R: `ggseasonplot()`

Seasonal pattern to be seen clearly
Changes in seasonality over time

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4}
ggsubseriesplot(a10) + ylab("$ million") +
  ggtitle("Subseries plot: antidiabetic drug sales")
```

## Seasonal subseries plots

  * Data for each season collected together in time plot as separate time series.
  * Enables the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen clearly, and changes in seasonality over time to be visualized.
  * In R: `ggsubseriesplot()`

## Quarterly Australian Beer Production

```{r, fig.height=4}
beer <- window(ausbeer,start=1992)

```

## Quarterly Australian Beer Production

```{r, fig.height=4}

```

## Your turn

The `arrivals` data set comprises quarterly international arrivals (in thousands) to Australia from Japan, New Zealand, UK and the US.

  - Use `autoplot()` and `ggseasonplot()` to compare the differences between the arrivals from these four countries.
  - Can you identify any unusual observations?

## arrivals

```{r, fig.height=4}
autoplot(arrivals, year.labels=TRUE, continuous=TRUE) +
  ggtitle("International Arrivals to Australia")  

#ggseasonplot(arrivals) +
#    ggtitle("International Arrivals to Australia")  
```  

# Seasonal or cyclic?

## Time series patterns

Trend
  : pattern exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data.

Seasonal
  : pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week).

Cyclic
  : pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are \emph{not of fixed period} (duration usually of at least 2 years).

## Time series components

### Differences between seasonal and cyclic patterns:

* seasonal pattern constant length; cyclic pattern variable length
* average length of cycle longer than length of seasonal pattern
* magnitude of cycle more variable than magnitude of seasonal pattern

## Time series patterns

```{r, fig.height=4}
autoplot(window(elec, start=1980)) +
  ggtitle("Australian electricity production") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("GWh")
```

## Time series patterns

```{r, fig.height=4}
autoplot(bricksq) +
  ggtitle("Australian clay brick production") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("million units")
```

## Time series patterns

```{r, fig.height=4}
autoplot(hsales) +
  ggtitle("Sales of new one-family houses, USA") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Total sales")
```

## Time series patterns

```{r, fig.height=4}
autoplot(ustreas) +
  ggtitle("US Treasury Bill Contracts") +
  xlab("Day") + ylab("price")
```

## Time series patterns

```{r, fig.height=4}
autoplot(lynx) +
  ggtitle("Annual Canadian Lynx Trappings") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Number trapped")
```

## Seasonal or cyclic?

Differences between seasonal and cyclic patterns:

  * seasonal pattern constant length; cyclic pattern variable length
  * average length of cycle longer than length of seasonal pattern
  * magnitude of cycle more variable than magnitude of seasonal pattern

The timing of peaks and troughs is predictable with seasonal data, but unpredictable in the long term with cyclic data.

# Lag plots and autocorrelation

## Example: Beer production

```{r, fig.height=4}
beer <- window(ausbeer, start=1992)
gglagplot(beer)
```

## Lagged scatterplots

  * Each graph shows $y_t$ plotted against $y_{t-k}$ for different values of $k$.
  * The autocorrelations are the correlations associated with these scatterplots.

## Autocorrelation

**Covariance** and **correlation**: measure extent of **linear relationship** between two variables ($y$ and $X$).\pause

**Autocovariance** and **autocorrelation**: measure linear relationship between **lagged values** of a time series $y$.\pause

We measure the relationship between:

  * $y_{t}$ and $y_{t-1}$
  * $y_{t}$ and $y_{t-2}$
  * $y_{t}$ and $y_{t-3}$
  * etc.

## Autocorrelation

We denote the sample autocovariance at lag $k$ by $c_k$ and the sample autocorrelation at lag $k$ by $r_k$.  Then define

c_k &= \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=k+1}^T (y_t-\bar{y})(y_{t-k}-\bar{y}) \\[0.cm]
\text{and}\qquad
r_{k} &= c_k/c_0


  * $r_1$ indicates how successive values of  $y$  relate to each other
  * $r_2$ indicates how  $y$ values two periods apart relate to each other
  * $r_k$ is **almost** the same as the sample correlation between $y_t$ and $y_{t-k}$.

## Autocorrelation

Results for first 9 lags for beer data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
beeracf <- matrix(acf(c(beer), lag.max=9,
                      plot=FALSE)$acf[-1,,1], nrow=1)
colnames(beeracf) <- paste("$r_",1:9,"$",sep="")
knitr::kable(beeracf, booktabs=TRUE,
             align="c", digits=3,
             format.args=list(nsmall=3))
```

```{r beeracf, fig.height=2.5}
ggAcf(beer)
```

## Autocorrelation

  * $r_{4}$  higher than for the other lags. This is due to **the seasonal pattern in the data**: the peaks tend to be **4 quarters** apart and the troughs tend to be **2 quarters** apart.
  * $r_2$ is more negative than for the other lags because troughs tend to be 2 quarters behind peaks.
  * Together, the autocorrelations at lags 1, 2, $\dots$, make up the **autocorrelation** or ACF.
  * The plot is known as a **correlogram**

## ACF

Peaks are evry four quarters apart and tend are two quarters apart

```{r, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
ggAcf(beer)
```

## Trend and seasonality in ACF plots

- When data have a trend, the autocorrelations for small lags tend to be large and positive.
- When data are seasonal, the autocorrelations will be larger at the seasonal lags (i.e., at multiples of the seasonal frequency)
- When data are trended and seasonal, you see a combination of these effects.

## Aus monthly electricity production

```{r, fig.height=3}
elec2 <- window(elec, start=1980)
autoplot(elec2)
```
- The data is trended up and seasonal, you see a combination of these effects in acf.

## Aus monthly electricity production

```{r, fig.height=4}
ggAcf(elec2, lag.max=48)
```

## Aus monthly electricity production

Time plot shows clear trend and seasonality.

The same features are reflected in the ACF.

  * The slowly decaying ACF indicates trend (updward).
  * The ACF peaks at lags 12, 24, 36, $\dots$, indicate seasonality of length 12.

## Google stock price

```{r, fig.height=4}
autoplot(goog)
```

## Google stock price

```{r, fig.height=4}

# White noise

## Example: White noise

```{r}
wn <- ts(rnorm(36))
autoplot(wn)
```

## Example: White noise

```

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
wnacf <- matrix(acf(c(wn), lag.max=10,

Sample autocorrelations for white noise series.

We expect each autocorrelation to be close to zero.

## Sampling distribution of autocorrelations

Sampling distribution of $r_k$ for white noise data is asymptotically N(0,$1/T$).\pause

  *  95% of all $r_k$ for white noise must lie within $\pm 1.96/\sqrt{T}$.
  * If this is not the case, the series is probably not WN.
  * Common to plot lines at $\pm 1.96/\sqrt{T}$ when plotting ACF.
These are the \textcolor{orange}{\textbf{\emph{critical values}}}.

## Autocorrelation

Example:

$T=36$ and so critical values at $\pm 1.96/\sqrt{36} = \pm 0.327$.

All autocorrelation coefficients lie within these
limits, confirming  that the data are white noise. (More precisely, the data cannot be distinguished rom white noise.)


## Example: Pigs slaughtered

```{r, fig.height=3}
pigs2 <- window(pigs, start=1990)
autoplot(pigs2) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("thousands") +
  ggtitle("Number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria")
```

## Example: Pigs slaughtered

```{r}
ggAcf(pigs2)
```

## Example: Pigs slaughtered

Monthly total number of pigs slaughtered
in the state of Victoria, Australia, from January 1990 through August 1995.
(Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics.)

  * Difficult to detect pattern in time plot.
  * ACF shows some significant autocorrelation at lags 1, 2, and 3.
  * $r_{12}$ relatively large although not significant.  This may indicate some slight seasonality.

These show the series is **not a white noise series**.

## Your turn

You can compute the daily changes in the Google stock price using

```r
dgoog <- diff(goog)
```

Does `dgoog` look like white noise? Ans. It does not.
```{r, , fig.height=3.5, echo=FALSE}
acf(goog)
```
